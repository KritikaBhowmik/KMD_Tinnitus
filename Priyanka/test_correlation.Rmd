## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#correlation

 corr_check <- function(Dataset, threshold){
   matriz_cor <- cor(Dataset)
   matriz_cor
   
   for (i in 1:nrow(matriz_cor)){
     correlations <-  which((abs(matriz_cor[i,i:ncol(matriz_cor)]) > threshold) & (matriz_cor[i,i:ncol(matriz_cor)] != 1))
     
     if(length(correlations)> 0){
       lapply(correlations,FUN =  function(x) (cat(paste(colnames(Dataset)[i], "with",colnames(Dataset)[x]), "\n")))
       
     }
   }
 }
 
 corr_check(test, 0.85)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
